    def description = '''\\
This plugin provides easy access to external processes. You can pass command line arguments and input files
in zip format.
You can use this to create dvi/pdf from latex, images from gnuplot, calculation results from ansys and/or 
simple directory listings.

You can easily expose/consume external processes via web service making it easy to maintain only one 
installation of the external process and use them from your application remotely.
